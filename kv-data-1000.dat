9de22156-78a5-463f-8a60-f1232e64e732 @115769 are there any plans to add a fast crop mode for the iPad version of LR? It takes too many taps and slows down workflow.
ee0a3be2-62b9-44e5-99a8-b0f461db7378 @115775 Thanks for sharing the file, we'll get back to you with updates as we investigate. ^Wren
921fb1e2-121f-420f-8dfc-06841732fcc6 @AdobeCare @115776 It‚Äôs intermittent for me. This file fails reliably: https://t.co/6m5a1RQEV9  The ‚ÄúCreate subfolder‚Äù option just makes an empty ‚Äúsvg‚Äù folder
8f7b0389-5253-4e3f-8e8a-8b41e4a6cc32 @115776 Unfortunately, we are not able to reproduce it at our end. I'll still be checking with the development team to find out more on this. ^OM https://t.co/3giRhN4vNJ
05abe03b-81a8-4df7-a02a-b0186b00163d @AdobeCare Seems pretty widespread: https://t.co/ImomzTHO5j  Don't mean to be a jerk, but it's frustrating when an update breaks core functionality.
17e72e2f-e098-4702-924d-2c108bac9bf9 @115776 Hi Keelin, Sorry for the inconvenience. I am able to export SVG in AI CC 2018. Would you mind sharing your workflow, sample file/screenshot? https://t.co/iuwZCjz4Or
f193bf6e-b9aa-42b0-80ed-fda04a3270f1 So apparently the new version of @115777 @115778 has this cool feature where you can't export SVGs. Sick update guys.
20ca189c-58b2-43a7-acf5-2b555a2ee48c @115779 Hi Duncan, please update Lightroom to 6.13 from the following link: https://t.co/9vaI2tzHd6 .  ^Tanuj
4cf68cfc-1e22-4b87-88cf-4f17f68580c1 @115769 I'm worried as if I update my LR6 standalone programme I could lose it due to the new online version....is this true and if so is this fair!

3083bf29-acf5-489b-868d-93f6019c437f @115919 When amending a ticket the system would show a fare that matches your previous purchase, but this may be higher ^CB

31624f0e-0afb-46d3-9a19-3f46a4f73786 @115921 Yes it does. You need to select the return journey then in the ticket flexibility menu you can select open return ^CB
21c41dc6-4f7f-4c7f-b4db-75e6aabce8d2 @VirginTrains Thanks, see it now. Real shame about how poor the new App is though.
4b6ca538-44eb-45e7-af60-14cf2dbf9512 @VirginTrains Hi- does the new app have an option to buy an open return?

7fa4f95f-4f3b-4280-b262-6abbcedb9aef @VirginTrains What are your targets for next season? I see your prices go up, so I assume you've set performance targets reflective of that.
a8c527e6-2d5a-4750-8e73-2c728f7d773b @115923 These delays are out of our control, but we do work with Network Rail to try and reduce any problems ^CB
014992c6-7fc9-4d26-88c5-7b578625ef39 @VirginTrains Oh, that's nice. What are you doing about it? What are you targets next year?
ecc8b737-9a20-4807-bd22-65cf4aec2617 @115923 I understand the frustration this causes, Andy ^CB
6f11e85b-39ea-4298-b9db-ab75f4067b79 @VirginTrains Always some supposedly acceptable reason, yes I get that, but when one uses the trains every week and spends a lot of money, for it to be late regularly is just not acceptable.
209d24ea-3732-4cca-b5b0-2ba1c426fe90 @115923 Sadly the service has been delayed due to a fault on the line ^CB
9a504866-2c19-49bc-8dbe-9e9374792d4b @VirginTrains The 06:20 from Euston. Now I'm here waiting on the 19:00 from B'ham int. Also late.

3b7e0972-3cc0-4a9f-ba89-7e6416673ce9 @115936 Hi. Sorry to hear the buyers have not followed through. Did you open an unpaid item claim? You can set buyer requirements which will block buyers who have strikes against them which will reduce this from happening. See here&gt; https://t.co/5GCQb0IEA0. Thanks ^SG
81b30055-c227-4296-a00a-2c7f835a056b EVERYTIME i sell something on @115937 @AskeBay the bid comes back as fraudulent and i have to repost.  7 days wasted.  I‚Äôm done.  Ugh.
ac971de4-c76d-484c-bf00-2249da5ce37e @115938 Hi there. Sorry to hear the item has not arrived. Is there tracking for the item? If not, I'd advise opening an item not received claim. You can learn more about that here&gt; https://t.co/0toc8cKSB0. Any other questions, let us know. ^SG
a2d0313b-c626-41c5-8607-87cfc4024c55 @AskeBay The item has been marked as delivered, and the system would not let me contact ebay customer service directly. It was not sellers fault, it was mismanaged somewhere between shipment and delivery. Still file a claim?
ac195bfa-f9d7-44f8-be0f-6d0bc26829c2 @AskeBay Need to contact customer service directly. Please DM contact email for customer service
61ae0dd6-af04-4a9e-8662-ca86c9c94a3f @115938 As the seller is responsible for the courier, they can claim for lost items from the courier. You still have to open a claim through eBay to be protected. Please follow the previous steps. We cant outbound DM. You can DM us if you have any other questions. ^SG
cd8cbd1d-4d81-48bb-a6e7-010ef750b3bb @AskeBay Ok, thank you for your help, I'll do that.

da982bfa-560f-4fe1-a3d5-73bfdc647d64 @hulu_support Getting to the lists of episodes.  It‚Äôs not difficult.  Just way more annoying.  Plus you can‚Äôt see as many choices on screen at once.

9329efdd-8f95-412a-8178-83be2447b2d3 @hulu_support Hi! Someone changed my password (hacked). Asked reset link x 3 over an hour ago - no email. Not in junk. What can I do?

0cf37d74-4597-43f8-adb5-190c450b3c3b @hulu_support @115942 I think we understand HOW it works, it's just frustrating that it USED to be much more user-friendly before this update.

863d21b7-ca28-4e50-b8ad-bd2d31c56a71 @hulu_support It‚Äôs not intuitive. Takes me too long to find the episode I want instead of the episode presented to me.

9a80cec6-0920-44de-b601-0991e4a02f00 @115944 @115940 Yep. Challenging. Frustrating. Things you don‚Äôt need when you‚Äôre just trying to watch Bob‚Äôs Burgers.
8c4a9079-3790-441b-bcb9-3495df8e07b9 @115942 @115940 It's....very challenging.
4540292c-343d-4b0c-94d6-284ca656fb90 I feel it‚Äôs important to remind @115940 that its new interface has made watching what you want to watch nearly impossible. Zero stars.

fa7a69ca-55e8-4e23-b3d8-b146fffed487 @116025 Have you asked the seller yet where it is? See https://t.co/n4jUdNSd5z as they may be able to help out! ^D
8f7f7aaf-b892-41c7-9e5f-d976c632fa7e @AskeBay I have contacted seller but my question to you is when will I receive my product. Your customer service says may be the awb no.  is wrong.
076f8673-f664-44dc-9bd4-4f1bf95b048a @AskeBay I don't care about that I want my product. . I wish I had not opted ebay.but in future I am not going to choose eBay . Because Its the worst
2af9183d-4f3d-4d4f-97d6-3dbc3ac2e338 @116025 The seller should have delivered it by then, but as you don't have it just see https://t.co/Yh3pSrspGY if the seller can't help! ^D
370cd6fb-3835-4a01-bff4-ed71690076da @AskeBay I haven't received it as of yet. And I have a contract with you for the delivery of product not with seller.
b2ea9b36-15ac-4aa7-b879-0c6e2e2aa4a1 @AskeBay So, instead of telling me to contact the seller you guys should contact the seller.
6739811d-e493-414a-8287-8c258f9c24f9 @116025 The contract is between you and the seller! They shipped it, but we protect you if you didn't get it if you open a case. ^D
29fe0967-6c78-46bf-a84d-6a25c14d87c4 @AskeBay I haven't received anything as of yet. I'll contact seller tomorrow morning. But your service is pathetic.

296365e5-8ef7-485c-b26b-58aee6f4ddba @AskeBay I would appreciate that I got the refund of my previous damaged product from eBay. But where are the timelines for delivery.
af2dbf77-b92c-4ec7-a515-8056986c7165 @AskeBay The email address associated with my account is __email__ .
4e1dd66b-e98f-41c8-a77a-7fb13aadb9a1 @AskeBay I'm not looking for the refund. Just check my account and you would yourself condemn your service and worst packing .
8fe9d975-101f-4cad-8e66-5f90f17147b1 @AskeBay And I haven't received it yet so in layman terms you can say I'm Waiting for it from 9th of Oct. How much time can I wait.
